## Running the Code
Run
```
go run main.go
```
or
```
./lan-chat
```
## Exiting the program
Exiting the chat by typing 'exit' is the safest option. You can also use ctrl-C, but if your terminal appears frozen or blank after this, make sure your input is empty and then type 'stty echo', following by Enter.
